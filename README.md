The project is based on https://arxiv.org/abs/2203.14449.

Our algorithm presents full reduction results for the propagator having power two for box and pentagon.

The original complete reduction coefficients are compressed and stored in f2111.zip (box) and f21111.zip (pentagon).

We wrote corresponding programs, BoxPrint.nb and PenPrint.nb, to decompress and output specific coefficients in Mathematica format.
